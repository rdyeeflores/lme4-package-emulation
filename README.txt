This is an off-shoot from a course about multi-level modeling (as known as mixed-effects modeling or hierarchical linear modeling), a departure from classical regression modeling. 

Much of the same formulae used in computing classical regression model coefficients, and other model components, vary substantially for mixed-effects models. 

This project was an attempt at learning more about mixed-effects modeling by emulating some of the computational components of lme4.
