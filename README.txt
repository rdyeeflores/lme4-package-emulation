This is a project for a course on multi-level modeling (as known as mixed-effects modeling or hierarchical linear modeling), which is a statistical method that is similar to classical regression modeling, but with substantially different computational approaches. 

To understand more about these computational differences, components of the lme4 function, lmer(), were emulated.
