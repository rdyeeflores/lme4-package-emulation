This is a project for a course about multi-level modeling (as known as mixed-effects modeling or hierarchical linear modeling), which could be viewed as a departure from classical regression modeling. 

Much of the same formulae used in computing classical regression model coefficients, and other model components, vary substantially for mixed-effects models. 

This was an exercise in learning more about mixed-effects modeling by emulating the computational components of the lme4 function, lmer().
